# PROJECT SIMPLE SHELL

**Introduction**

In this simple shell project, we simulate sh (sh is a shell or command line interpreter for computer operating systems).

**Project information**

The project was developed with the following requirements:

- Editors: `vi`, `emacs`
- The files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- C programs and functions will be compiled with `gcc 4.8.4` using the following flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic and -g`. After compiling memcheck is validated: `valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes ./hsh`.

**how to run this simulation of sh?**

1. Pull master branch: 

  `git pull https://github.com/jpenariasholberton/simple_shell.git`

2. Compile all C and header files:

  `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -g simple_shell.h *.c -o hsh`

3. Run the output file locally to start:

  `$ ./hsh`

4.You can start typing with a simple command like:

  `$ echo welcome`

**Commands you can use**

* `cat` - prints and concatenates files to the standard output
* `cp` -copies a file into another file
* `grep` - helps to search for a file in a specific pattern
* `less` - will let you go backward and forward in the files
* `ls`- will list all files and directories in current working directory
* `mv` - helps to move one file into another file
* `pwd - given you the current working directory.
